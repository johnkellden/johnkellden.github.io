 "In a network, in our 21C - we are transitioning into a butterfly called Transparency."

How Does a Caterpillar Turn into a Butterfly?

"To become a butterfly, a caterpillar first digests itself. But certain groups of cells survive, turning the soup into eyes, wings, antennae and other adult structures."

You are noticing it happening everywhere. DWS is fighting back against the Bernie Sanders movement. Monsanto is fighting against a growing awareness among social activists, food activists, permaculture activists. All activists, all movement members are imaginal cells. A great many of the old, increasingly obsolete institutions: Monsanto, Goldman Sachs, DNC, GOP - together forms the Chrysalis. Inside these institutions, there's a growing realization: their time is up.

It doesn't matter, whether they've stashed their loot in Panama, or at 1209 North Orange Street in Wilmington. Delaware, (Donald Trump AND Hillary Clinton) - their time is up.

If anything, all those human beings who weren't able to handle the combo of money and power - they need healing more than anything else.

Corporations and Pitchforks
The corporations who will resist all this, will bring pitchforks on themselves. One essential skill in the 21C, is our ability to tell humans apart from corporations.

Awareness is the trimtab. Trust, trusting your loved ones, your friends is what will make you more fully, more consciously, more intentionally engage and participate in the process.

"Trust movement."
-- Alfred Adler

What is transparency?
Transparency is a different quality than cronyism. It is different than lobbyism. It is different than getting rich followed by I got mine Jack. It is different. It is your eyes, your minds eye, your hearts eye, your spiritual vision.

“If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.”
-- William Blake

Can I Sleep Through The Transition?
No, you can't. There's no cozy corner to the side of events, where you get to stay in contentment, where you get to remain in denial, where you get to turn yourself less than moving, seemingly safe inside your comfort zone, your zone of entitlement. This is not a spectator sport. Check your self. If you are human, if you are one of the 7bn going on 9bn, you are always and already, one invaluable part and proactive participant.

What's the Process?

contentment, denial, confusion, renewal

followed by a new level of contentment, along spiralling evolutionary trajectories.

What's the Outcome?

"We made it? What happened? We happened."

What's my next step?
First, you wake up. Then you venture one small step outside your own comfort zone, one small step beyond your own denial. There's a growing number of us having already done that. You'll find us. You are most welcome.
